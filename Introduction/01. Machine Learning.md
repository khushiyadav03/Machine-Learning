# Machine Learning

Machine learning is about creating computer programs that can **learn from data**.  
Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, these programs improve their performance on a specific task as they are exposed to more data.  
This learning process allows them to make predictions or decisions **without being directly told how to do so**.

## Types of Machine Learning

Machine learning algorithms learn from data to make predictions or decisions. These algorithms are broadly categorized into:

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Uses **labeled data** to train a model.  
- Goal: Learn mapping from **inputs â†’ outputs**.  
- Example: Predicting house prices from features (size, location, etc.).

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Works with **unlabeled data**.  
- Goal: Discover **hidden patterns or structures**.  
- Example: Customer segmentation using clustering.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Involves training an **agent** to make decisions in an environment.  
- Goal: **Maximize a reward** through trial and error.  
- Example: Teaching a robot to walk or an AI to play chess.

### 4. Semi-Supervised Learning
- Uses a combination of **labeled + unlabeled data**.  
- Helps when labeled data is scarce but unlabeled data is abundant.

### 5. Self-Supervised Learning
- The data itself provides the **supervision signal**.  
- Common in modern deep learning (e.g., NLP and computer vision models).
