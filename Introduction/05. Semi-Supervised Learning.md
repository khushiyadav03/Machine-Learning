# Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a machine learning technique that combines the strengths of both **supervised** and **unsupervised learning**.  

---

## How It Works
- The algorithm is trained on:
  - A **small labeled dataset**  
  - A **large unlabeled dataset**  
- The labeled data helps guide the learning process for the much larger set of unlabeled data.  

A common workflow:
1. Use **unsupervised learning** to identify data clusters.  
2. Use **supervised learning** to label those clusters.

## Example: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- GANs are a deep learning tool that can generate synthetic **unlabeled data**.  
- They work by training two neural networks:
  - **Generator** → Creates new data samples.  
  - **Discriminator** → Evaluates whether data is real or generated.  
- This process makes GANs useful in **semi-supervised learning tasks**.

## Applications
- Text classification with limited labeled data  
- Medical imaging (when annotations are expensive)  
- Fraud detection  
- Speech analysis  

---

## Challenges
- Models can still be **sensitive to human/data bias**.  
- Ensuring **responsible AI practices** is critical when applying semi-supervised learning in organizations.
