# Self-Supervised Machine Learning

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) enables models to **train themselves on unlabeled data**, instead of requiring massive annotated and labeled datasets.  

SSL algorithms are also called:
- **Predictive learning algorithms**  
- **Pretext learning algorithms**  

---

## How It Works
- SSL learns **one part of the input from another part**.  
- It automatically generates **labels** from raw data.  
- This transforms an **unsupervised problem → into a supervised one**.  

---

## Why It’s Useful
- Reduces the need for large, expensive **human-labeled datasets**.  
- Especially powerful in fields where massive labeled datasets are hard to obtain.  

---

## Applications
- **Computer Vision** → Image recognition, object detection, image segmentation  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** → Language models, translation, text embeddings  
- **Speech Recognition** → Voice-to-text, speaker identification
